Shiny app documentation

GDP time series and growth analysis application. 

In the first tab of the app you are able to select from a drop down menu of counties. Select as few as one or as many as you’d like. 
A time series plot will be displayed on the right side after a country as been select. 
Selecting multiple countries will display their time series plots simultaneously. 
Also, there is a slider input that you can use to specify the timeframe you’d like the plot to show. Simply backspace to remove a country from the plot. 

In the second tab called GDP Growth analysis, you can do two things. 
First you can select any county and specify the timeframe you’d like to focus on in the text boxes to the right. 
Then hit the “Calculate Growth Rate” button and the growth rate for that specific country over that specified timeframe will be displayed. 
Second is you can use the slider above the calculate button to adjust the time period for 5 GDP growth rates show at the bottom of the tab. 
These are the top 5 GDP growth rates for the specified timeframe you’ve chosen.
